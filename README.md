# Neon Circles
## A game of shapes and shooting things
The world has ended in a pulse of neon. Terrible demons have risen from the void. Only you, space cowboy, have what it takes to defeat the demons and save humanity. Can you find your way out of the neon circles!?

### Description
Neon Circles is a claustrophobic shoot-em-up in the likeness of Space Invaders and Asteroids. Your character is stuck on the inside of a circle and can only point towards the center. To shoot the demons shooting you, you need to aim through the circle and out the other side. But be careful! Running into your own bullets will hurt just as much as running into the enemyâ€™s.

### Gameplay
Players control a ship stuck on the inside of a small circle. The ship cannot leave this circle, but can travel around its inner perimeter freely. Enemies will fly towards the player from off-screen. If an enemy touches the player, it's game over. Complicating this simple setup, the player's ship is always orientated *away* from the enemies and towards the center of the circle. Players can only shoot towards the center of the circle, forcing their bullets to pass through the circle itself to hit enemies. This causes bullets to directly intersect the only path the player can take. If a player hits their own bullets -- it's game over!

### Architecture and Technologies
